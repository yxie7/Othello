# Othello
Recreated the game of othello onto windows form application as a project for my Component-Based Software Design Class.<br />

Othello (also known as 'reversi') is a 2-player game where players take turns placing pieces on the board to take possesion of opponent pieces and that are inbetween the player's pieces in a straight line.<br />
This goes on until the board is completely full or there are no more valid moves for either players. <br />
The player with the most pieces at by the end of the game wins.<br />

Game is fully functional and also shows available moves for each player.<br />
